        <p className="text-md md:text-lg text-gray-600 md:tracking-wide md:leading-loose" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">Adaptation involves changing human and natural systems to respond to the future impacts of climate change. In other words, adaptation is an attempt to address the effects of a problem.</p>
        <p className="text-md md:text-lg text-gray-600 md:tracking-wide md:leading-loose" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">We begin by raising awareness of the need for climate adaptation. Preliminary climate change vulnerability or risk assessments are the first step for your organization. We will then discuss your organization and its context, which will lead to setting achievable goals that work for both your business and the environment together and can be maintained. In addition to developing climate change adaptation plans for your organizations, emergency preparedness and response plans can be enhanced to address anticipated climate change impacts. Also, we offer effective and detailed training on these actions for a smooth transition to a more climate-conscious business.</p>

          <p className="text-md md:text-lg text-gray-600 md:tracking-wide md:leading-loose" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">Mitigation strategy is one that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. In other words, mitigation helps to address the cause of the problem.</p>
          <p className="text-md md:text-lg text-gray-600 md:tracking-wide md:leading-loose" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">Our climate change mitigation services help clients by working on emissions reduction opportunities. We assist clients in converting well-thought-out solutions into practical implementation. We are providing GHG quantification and reporting on behalf of clients, according to state-of-the-art, jurisdictional, and other requirements, such as ISO standards, government programmes such as the GHG Mitigation Assessment process that adheres to the Climate Lens Assessment Guidelines that Infrastructure Canada developed in 2019 and 2020, or even voluntary programs.</p>

          <p className="text-md md:text-lg text-gray-600 md:tracking-wide md:leading-loose" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">Climate risk assessments identify the likelihood of future climate hazards and their potential impacts on cities and their communities. This is fundamental for informing the prioritization of climate action and investment in adaptation.</p>
          <p className="text-md md:text-lg text-gray-600 md:tracking-wide md:leading-loose" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">We can assist clients in conducting climate change risk assessments that adhere to international standards such as ISO 14090:2019 Adaptation to Climate Change: Principles, Requirements, and Guidelines or ISO 14091:2021 Adaptation to Climate Change: Guidelines on Vulnerability, Impacts, and Risk Assessment. Additionally, we can help organizations with climate change resilience assessments that follow the guidelines for Climate Lens Assessments that Infrastructure Canada developed in 2019 and 2020. These risk and resilience assessments are the foundation for planning and implementing climate change adaptation.</p>
